# Password-Generator

## Description

My motivation for this challenge was to really get to grip with using functions as per this weeks lectures. I found this challenge relatively straight forward and found that using functions was a massive help as it allowed me to break the challenge up into smaller chunks and then bring the solution together at the end. 

The aim of the challenge was to create an application that generates a password, based on criteria provided by the user via a series of prompts and confirmations. The password generated is to match the user criteria given. If the user entered invalid data, i.e. not a number between 10 and 64, the user would be prompted again.
